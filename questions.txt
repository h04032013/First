ALGEBRA/7TH GRADE
1. im in 7th grade explain a function to me
2. If A=2+i, O=-4, P=-i, and S=2+4i, find A-O+P+S
3. The perimeter of a rectangle is 24 inches. What is the number of square inches in the maximum possible area for this rectangle?
4.Find the distance between the points $(-5,-2)$ and $(7,3)
5. (prealg 0) Megan has lost Fatima's phone number. Megan knows that the first 
three digits are either 296 or 299. The remaining four digits 
are 0, 1, 6 and 7, but she isn't sure of the order of these digits. 
If Megan randomly dials a seven-digit number that meets these 
conditions, what is the probability that she dials 
Fatima's correct number? Express your answer as a common fraction.

GEOMETRY
1. Square ABCD has its center at $(8,-8)$ and has an area of 4 
square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. The square is 
then dilated with the dilation center at (0,0) and a scale factor of 2. 
What are the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square ABCD 
that is farthest from the origin? Give your answer as an ordered pair

2. At the MP Donut Hole Factory, Niraek, Theo, and Akshaj are coating spherical 
donut holes in powdered sugar.  Niraek's donut holes have radius 6 mm, Theo's 
donut holes have radius 8 mm, and Akshaj's donut holes have radius 10 mm.  All 
three workers coat the surface of the donut holes at the same rate and start at 
the same time.  Assuming that the powdered sugar coating has negligible thickness 
and is distributed equally on all donut holes, how many donut holes will Niraek 
have covered by the first time all three workers finish their current donut hole 
at the same time?

PRECALCULUS
Trigonometry:
"I'm having trouble understanding how to convert between radians and degrees. If I have an angle of 5π665π​ radians, how do I convert that to degrees?"

Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:
"Can you explain how to solve this equation using logarithms? I’m stuck on 5x=2005x=200. What steps do I take?"

DISCRETE MATH
Here are five sample discrete math questions, covering different topics:

    Set Theory:
    "How do I prove that A∪(B∩C)=(A∪B)∩(A∪C)? I'm confused about how to use set identities to show this."

LINEAR ALGEBRA
Here are five sample linear algebra questions that cover various areas of the subject:

1. Matrix Operations
   "Can you explain how to multiply two matrices? For example, how would I compute the product of the matrices A=[[2,3],[1,4]]and B = [[5,6],[7,8]]?"

2. **Determinants**:  
   "How do I find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix? I’m working on [[2,0,1],[3,-1,4],[5,2,6]], but I’m not sure what steps to take."

   "Can you walk me through how to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix? For example, how would I find them for the matrix A=[[4,1],[2,3]]?"

4. **Vector Spaces**:  
   "I’m having trouble understanding the concept of a basis for a vector space. Could you explain how to determine if the set of vectors {(1, 2, 3), (2, 1, 0), (0, 3, 1)} forms a basis for R^3?"

5. **Linear Transformations**:  
   "How do I find the matrix representation of a linear transformation? For example, if I have the transformation T: R^2 to R^2 defined by ( T(x, y) = (2x + 3y, 4x - y)), how do I represent T as a matrix?"
